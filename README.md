![screenshot](fifa_logo.png)

## **Status:** Completed (March 19, 2023)

## **Project Description**

This project is a personal project portfolio of mine as I am avid sports fan and video game enthusiast. The goal of this project is to analyze FIFA 23 game data for male players using tools such as Excel, SQL(Google Big Query), and Power BI to inform the gaming practices for a potential newcomer to the EA FIFA gaming franchise. 

The focus of this analysis was on three key aspects of playing the FIFA career mode: 

* Overall Rating 

* Transfer Values

* Potential Rating

## **Data Source**

The dataset for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-23-complete-player-dataset). Note that only the male players and male teams dataset were used for this project. However, all other datasets were cleaned and kept for future purposes.

## **Tools**

* Excel functions were used to clean the data since it was already in csv format. 

* The clean data was then loaded unto Google's Big Query Sandbox environment for analysis with SQL. 

* Finally, the results of the SQL queries were exported and visualized with Power BI instead of Tableau as it was originally intended. 

## **Table of Contents**

This repository contains the following: 

* A report of the entire cleaning process and all necessary documentation (still to be written)

* A Power BI [document](https://github.com/deengini/fifa23_male_players_project/blob/main/FIFA23_male_players.pbix) of the dashboard created. 

* Image files of the dashboard created as follows: 

  * [Ratings](https://github.com/deengini/fifa23_male_players_project/blob/main/FIFA23_male_players_ratings.jpg)

  * [Transfer Values](https://github.com/deengini/fifa23_male_players_project/blob/main/FIFA23_male_players_values.jpg) 

  * [Potential Ratings](https://github.com/deengini/fifa23_male_players_project/blob/main/FIFA23_male_players_potential.jpg)

## **Challenges**

Some of the challenges of this project include: 

* There was information about the nationality of the data and so it was difficult to provide insights based on nationality. 

* The data was gotten from a third party source and so may not meet ROCCC qualifications. 

* There was a lot of missing data and erroneous name data which made the project take way longer than normal.
